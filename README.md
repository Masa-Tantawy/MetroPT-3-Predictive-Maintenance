Predicting Air Production Unit (APU) failures in metro train operations is a critical challenge with profound implications for maintenance efficiency and operational reliability. Traditionally, preventive and reactive maintenance strategies have been employed, often relying on predefined schedules or post-failure responses. However, the dynamic nature of APU failures necessitates a more proactive and anticipatory approach.

The MetroPT-3 dataset is a valuable repository encapsulating the heartbeat of metro train operations. Derived from real-world readings within a compressorâ€™s Air Production Unit (APU), this dataset provides a comprehensive insight into the operational dynamics of metro systems. Collected parameters, including pressure, temperature, motor current, and air intake valves, offer a granular perspective on the intricate interplay of factors influencing APU functionality. This dataset, derived from real-world operations, not only showcases the difficulties involved in predictive maintenance within the metro train sector but also demonstrates the genuine nature of the data, establishing it as an indispensable asset for the creation and evaluation of predictive models. Its usefulness goes beyond predicting failures alone, providing a foundation for anomaly detection and other essential tasks that contribute to improving the dependability and effectiveness of metro train systems.

This project aims to identify instances of APU failures thus requiring maintenance. To effectively predict failures and spot issues in metro train systems, it's important to use data mining techniques that involve using advanced algorithms to find hidden patterns and irregularities in large datasets, including historical maintenance records, sensor data, and operational logs. To achieve this, multiple data mining techniques in addition to machine learning classifiers were used to be able to detect instances with APU failures.
